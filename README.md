#  Leftover Ingredient Recipe Generator

##  Project Overview

This project is a JavaScript-powered web application that allows users to input their leftover ingredients and generates a meal idea along with a complete recipe. It aims to reduce food waste by helping users make the most of what they already have in their kitchen.

This project is a culmination of skills developed in my previous projects, including the Travel Website and AI Limerick Generator. By leveraging front-end development, API integration, and user experience principles, I have built a solution that is both practical and impactful.
